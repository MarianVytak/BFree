                        Ukraine visa is an official document that stamps to your passport or travel document and permits
                        the owner to cross the border of Ukraine and stay in Ukraine for a specified time period. The
                        visa contains information about entry and leave date, visa type and the allowed number of
                        entries, as well as owner's passport data and the information about the host organization (visa
                        sponsor). Please note that visa is the document that permits both entry and exit; if you stay in
                        Ukraine for a period that is longer than specified by the visa or lose the passport with the
                        visa, leaving the country will be problematic

                        Every applicant should understand that to get Ukraine visa need to collect necessary documents.
                        Without this documents you will not be able to apply to Embassy of Ukraine. But also to get
                        Ukraine visa you need additional documents from your side (application form, tickets, bank
                        statement, cash, well known English language). Unfortunately even ambassador can't give you 100%
                        guaranty because Security Service of Ukraine and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine will
                        make decision about your visa. However, due to our 4-years experience of working with more than
                        a thousand clients from all over the world, we know for sure what factors affect on the result,
                        and we influe on exactly on them, which in turn increases chances for obtaining a visa.
